            <h1>What is a clothing swap?</h1>
            <p>First and foremost, a partyyyyy!</p>
            <p>Clothing swaps are used to exchange clothes and items within your community.</p>
            <p>Swapping with your friends extends the lifespan of the item and is a 
            responsible way to rehome clothing.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately when we donate clothes, a very small portion actually gets 
            redistributed. The majority get shipped to other countries and wind up in their 
            landfills. Making our waste another countries' problem.</p>

            <p>ðŸ™„</p>
            <p>So thank YOU for taking a step in slowing down your clothing consumption!</p>
            <p>I hope you're ready to find some dope ass swap swaAag!</p>
